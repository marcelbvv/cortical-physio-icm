## How to get set up ?

#### 1) Get a scientific python distribution

Install a python distribution for scientific analysis.

We recommend the Anaconda distribution, get it here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual


#### 2) Download this repository

Three options:

- For `git` users & contributors (requires a github account). 
  a) Fork this repository
  b) Clone your own fork this repository
  
- For other `git` users, clone the repository with:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/yzerlaut/cortical-physio-icm.git
  ```

- For others, download the [zip archive](https://github.com/yzerlaut/cortical-physio-icm/archive/master.zip)


#### 3) Open 

## Analysis of Calcium imaging

#### Registration and Cell detection

Use [Suite2P](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p), see instructions in the documentation at [http://mouseland.github.io/suite2p](http://mouseland.github.io/suite2p)
