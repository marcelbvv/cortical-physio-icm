# Visual stimulation

## Configuration/Installation

First install a python distribution from: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

The stimulus presentation relies on the [PsychoPy module](https://www.psychopy.org), you can install it through `pip`. Open a the Anaconda prompt and run:

```
pip install psychopy
```

The custom code for the GUI and the set of stimulus lies in the present repository: ["psychopy_code" folder](./psychopy_code/) and ["gui" folder](./gui/)

### Screen settings

The physical (visual space) and biological (neuronal space) settings are depicted on Figure {geometry}. 

[[Figure {geometry} around here]]

The visual space considered by the model corresponds to the monocular field of a given eye (e.g. left eye on Figure {geometry}) in the visual system of the mouse. 

The visual space covered by the screen is therefore described by the following parameters:

- Angular height of the visual field
- Angular width of the visual field
- Field center from antero-posterior axis



## Set of stimuli

We describe  the set of visual stimuli available in the module with their *parameters* in the (Stimulus Documentation)[stimuli.pdf].
